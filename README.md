## Description

- Ceaser cipher fucntion (introductory python)
    - Write a Caesar Cipher function. That is, write a function which:
    takes two inputs, a string for the message, and an integer for the shift
    returns a string that's just the input string with all of its characters shifted by the amount specified in the shift argument
    for each character in the string (including punctuation marks, special characters and capital letters) gets that character's Unicode v, and replaces it by       the character with the Unicode v + shift
    accounts for user inputs that aren't strings
    is as elegant and efficient as possible
    
- Rarebirds dictionaty identifier (intermediate python)
    - You’re on safari in the most dense, remote part of the South American rainforest as a zoologist.
    You’re looking for a number of birds of paradise whose rarity, elusiveness and ferociousness means they’ve never before been photographed.
    In order to get good photographs of these birds, you have a photographer with you; she’s carrying a very large and expensive camera. It’s your job to creep       ahead of the photographer, using your binoculars intermittently, and, once you see one of the birds, remain perfectly still, and communicate to your             photographer: a. Which bird it is, and b. Where the bird is, so she can photograph it.
    
- Bank transaction fucntion (advanced python)
    - Write a program that acts as a bank for the user! 
    
- Data science apps project; choosing the better appstore based on customer reviews (apple or google play store)
    - With the aid of the data science pipeline steps, we are going to answer the question of whether apple or google app store received better reviews and           choose which one to implement at a company. Using kaggle.com datasets
