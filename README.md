## Description

- Ceaser cipher fucntion (introductory python)
    - Write a Caesar Cipher function. That is, write a function which:
    takes two inputs, a string for the message, and an integer for the shift
    returns a string that's just the input string with all of its characters shifted by the amount specified in the shift argument
    for each character in the string (including punctuation marks, special characters and capital letters) gets that character's Unicode v, and replaces it by      the character with the Unicode v + shift
    accounts for user inputs that aren't strings
    is as elegant and efficient as possible
